```

### Product & Feature Updates

1.  **Waymo** is shaking things up by integrating the Gemini [smart assistant (AI News)](https://www.aibase.com/zh/news/23993) into its vehicles, setting a new standard for AI ethics. Leaked instructions, a massive 1200 lines, show Gemini as a super restrained co-pilot. It can handle weather chats and AC adjustments, but absolutely no interference with driving operations! The assistant's language is designed to be "elementary schooler"-friendly, clearly defining the safety and ethical boundaries for human-AI co-piloting.

2.  **X platform** just dropped a new [AI image editing feature (AI News)](https://www.aibase.com/zh/news/24012) powered by Grok! Users can now *poof* change post images with a single button click. But hold up, this move has seriously ticked off a ton of original artists and creators. Fearing their work might get maliciously altered, many are bailing out. The lack of proper copyright protection has sparked a fiery community debate. 🔥

### Frontier Research

1.  **Tsinghua University**, teaming up with Shengshu Technology, just open-sourced the ridiculously fast [TurboDiffusion (AI News)](https://www.qbitai.com/2025/12/365896.html)! Generating videos on a single RTX 5090 GPU now takes less than 2 seconds — that's over 200 times faster than the original model. The secret sauce? Their core SageAttention technology drastically slashes computational load. And get this: the video dynamics and lighting quality? Virtually no loss. Mind-blowing! 🤯

2.  **Nanjing University's** team just dropped RunawayEvil, a wicked [jailbreak framework (AI News)](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzA3MzI4MjgzMw==&mid=2651008926&idx=3&sn=62fd6830fa9878acb9029672ca09c19e) specifically designed to attack video models! This system boasts a soaring success rate of 87%. It uses a "strategy-tactic-action" self-evolving attack paradigm, causing mainstream video generation models to completely crumble before its onslaught. This breakthrough offers a crucial testing tool for patching up AI security vulnerabilities. 💡

3.  **Llama 3's** causal reasoning capabilities post-quantization: what's the [performance (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13725) like? Research found only a slight dip in intervention reasoning under NF4 precision. What's even cooler, GraphRAG (Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation) can actually boost reasoning accuracy! This provides solid theoretical backing for deploying Llama 3 on edge devices. 🚀

4.  **LLMs** acting as judges often suffer from a serious [agreement bias (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11822). They tend to dish out positive reviews while totally overlooking invalid outputs. But get this: a new method, using a regression model, has dramatically cut down the misjudgment rate! In code feedback tasks, the error was slashed by half. 🎉

5.  **AI** is now optimizing game strategies just like writing code! 🤯 LLMs are acting as optimizers, constantly rewriting strategy code. This approach effectively tackles the tricky challenge of multi-agent collaboration. In standard game theory scenarios, it's outperforming traditional methods big time. 🏆

6.  **REM** offers a fresh take on AI-generated image detection! Instead of fixating on forgery flaws, this new approach [REM (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20937) models the boundaries of real images. It generates near-authentic samples through self-reconstructing perturbations. This boosts detection rates significantly, even across different generators and under degradation conditions. Pretty neat, huh? ✨

### Industry Outlook & Social Impact

1.  **The US H-1B visa rules** just got a major shake-up, now implementing a [high-wage weighted (AI News)](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzI3MTA0MTk1MA==&mid=2652657511&idx=2&sn=fe18b45291ead0c5ca0d3d393d09a64e) system! The random lottery is out, replaced by screening based on salary tiers. This means about 90% of international students might get the boot. Entry-level applicants are seeing their chances plummet. Big tech players like Google are already restarting PERM to scoop up essential talent. Yikes! 😬

2.  **New York State** just officially signed the [RAISE Act (AI News)](https://www.aibase.com/zh/news/24016), a tough new bill to strictly regulate AI giants. Companies with annual revenues over $500 million now *must* disclose their safety protocols. And if an accident happens, they've got 72 hours to report it to the state government. This is a strong pushback against federal efforts to weaken state-level regulation. Non-compliant businesses could face fines up to $3 million. Ouch! 💸

3.  **Fliggy's** latest report is out, showing a whopping [20-fold surge (AI News)](https://www.qbitai.com/2025/12/365841.html) in travel AI token consumption! Users' average daily call volume also jumped 7.7 times. Folks are loving AI for finding killer flight deals and creating stress-free travel itineraries. Get this: 3 to 5 AM is apparently peak time for travel inspiration! 😴 AI is definitely moving beyond just generating info and into real transaction fulfillment. ✨

4.  **AI** rewriting eight years of [legacy code (AI News)](https://newshacker.me/story?id=46318080) in just three days? Fat chance! Discussions reveal LLMs are super prone to hitting roadblocks during large-scale migrations. They just can't grasp complex engineering contexts and implicit dependencies. However, for narrow, test-driven tasks, efficiency gets a clear boost. But a full takeover from human engineers? That's still pure fantasy for now. 🤷‍♂️

5.  **Google's 2025**: will it be a year of scientific breakthroughs or just an [ad show (AI News)](https://newshacker.me/story?id=46374018)? DeepMind's achievements in biology and meteorology are undeniable. Yet, the worsening search experience has users totally fed up. The Gemini vs. GPT showdown remains a neck-and-neck battle. There's growing concern: is commercial pressure squeezing out fundamental research? 🤔

2.  The **brackets in prompts** are actually just [placeholders (AI News)](https://x.com/dotey/status/2004025068498657334) for AI! No need to memorize symbol definitions; AI can figure out the context. Pretty smart, right? 🤔
    <br/>![AI News: AI Prompt Bracket Usage Diagram](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2025/12/news_01kdb1z1k9evys43r6t0ja8wxh.avif)<br/>

Perfection! ✨ <br/>![AI News: AI Generated Minimalist Pencil Sketch Example 2](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2025/12/news_01kdb1zrhkedgvvpae2rgfctwm.avif)<br/>

5.  **AI configuration management** is a mess! The config file formats across various AI tools are just plain [headache-inducing (AI News)](https://x.com/Jimmy_JingLv/status/2003855127543951685). We desperately need a unified standard to manage MCP configurations. Seriously, who's with me?! 😫
