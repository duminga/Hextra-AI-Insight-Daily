# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (which we'll just call 'the Site' or 'we' from now on)! 🥳 Before you dive into using any of our awesome services, please take a quick read through these Terms of Service. Seriously, it's important! By accessing or using the Site, you're pretty much saying 'Yep, I'm in!' and agreeing to these terms. Let's get started!

## 1. Service Overview
The Site (that's us!) hooks you up with some awesome paid subscription content and exclusive member services. We're talking everything from blog posts and special resources to e-books and vibrant community interactions. Just a heads-up: some of our premium goodies are exclusively for our subscribed members. 😉

## 2. User Registration & Accounts
- To set up your **account**, you'll need to provide a valid email address and create a password. Easy peasy!
- **Your account** is your responsibility! You're totally on the hook for its security and all the activities happening under it. Also, please don't even *think* about transferring or sharing your account – that's a hard **NO**. 🙅‍♀️
- If you, dear **user**, happen to violate these terms (don't do it!), **the Site** reserves the right to **suspend or terminate** your account. Just sayin'!

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
- **Subscription services** are billed either monthly or annually. You'll see all the fees super clearly laid out on the checkout page – no hidden stuff here! 💰
- All **payments** are processed super securely via third-party platforms like Stripe and PayPal. Good news: **the Site** never stores your actual payment info! Phew! 🔒
- Your **subscription** will **automatically renew**! So, if you decide to bounce, make sure to cancel before your current billing cycle wraps up. Otherwise, it'll just keep on rollin'! 🔄
- Let's talk about our **14-Day Refund Policy**! 🎉 If you're a first-time subscriber and our service isn't quite floating your boat within 14 days of purchase, you can totally snag a full refund. Just hit us up via the contact email at the very end of these terms and tell us why you're not feeling it. Quick note: this refund offer is a one-time deal per user! For anything beyond 14 days or for repeat subscribers, payments are generally **non-refundable**, unless the law *really* says otherwise. 😉

## 4. Content Usage & Intellectual Property
- All our killer **original content** is **copyrighted by the Site (hubtoday)**. Hands off! 🚫 You absolutely cannot copy, repost, or use it for any commercial shenanigans without getting our explicit permission first.
- **Users** only get a **non-exclusive, non-transferable access right** to our content. This is strictly for your personal learning and reading pleasure, cool? 👍
- If you're eyeing our content for **commercial use** or planning some **heavy-duty citations**, you *must* contact us to get authorization first. Don't be shy! 😉

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
- It's a hard **NO** to uploading, posting, or spreading *any* content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes on anyone else's rights. Let's keep our community awesome and respectful, shall we? 🚫
- Seriously, it's a huge **NO-GO** to use any technical trickery to bulk download, scrape, or crack our premium member content. Play fair, folks! 😠
- **The Site** absolutely has the right to zap any inappropriate content and will swiftly **ban users** who decide to break the rules. Consider this your friendly warning! 🚨

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
- **We** totally reserve the right to change, pause, or even completely stop some or all of our services whenever we need to, without giving you a heads-up. It's just how the digital cookie crumbles sometimes! 🍪
- If, for some wild reason (like an act of God, a server having a bad day, or a third-party service glitching out), our content becomes temporarily unavailable, **the Site** is **not responsible for any compensation**. We're bummed too, but sometimes things are just outta our hands! 😟

## 7. Disclaimer
- The **information provided on the Site** is strictly for reference only! It absolutely does **NOT** constitute any kind of professional advice (we're talking financial, legal, medical, etc.). Always check with an actual expert for that stuff! 🧠
- If you, dear **user**, happen to incur any direct or indirect losses from using **our content or services**, **the Site** is **absolutely not responsible**. Just making that super clear! 🛑

## 8. Governing Law
- **These Terms of Service** are governed by and will be interpreted according to the laws of California, USA. We're keeping it straightforward and *not* factoring in any tricky conflict-of-law principles! 🇺🇸
- For any **disputes** popping up from or related to these terms, we both agree to try and chat it out amicably first. If that doesn't quite work, you're cool with bringing the case to the courts with jurisdiction in Santa Clara County, California. Fair enough? 🤝
