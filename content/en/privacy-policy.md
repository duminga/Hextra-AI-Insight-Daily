# Privacy Policy

*Last Updated: June 1, 2025*

---

This Privacy Policy outlines our policies and procedures concerning the collection, use, and disclosure of your information when you use our Service. It also spills the tea on your privacy rights and how the law protects you.

We use your personal data to power and level up our Service. By using the Service, you're essentially giving us the nod to collect and use your info according to this Privacy Policy. 😉

## Interpretation and Definitions

### Interpretation
Capitalized words? They've got meanings defined under specific conditions. And guess what? These definitions rock, whether they show up in singular or plural form!

### Definitions
For the purpose of this Privacy Policy:

- **Account** means a unique account created just for you to access our Service or parts of it. 🚀

- **Affiliate** means an entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with a party. "Control" here means owning 50% or more of the shares, equity interest, or other securities that get to vote for directors or other management bodies. Pretty standard stuff!

- **Company** (we're talking "the Company," "We," "Us," or "Our" in this Agreement) refers to **hubtoday**. That's us! 😉

- **Cookies** are tiny files websites drop onto your computer, mobile, or any other device. They're like little memory keepers, holding details of your browsing history on that site for a bunch of uses.

- **Country** means: California, USA. 🌴 (Yep, that's where we hang!)

- **Device** means any gadget that can hit up the Service, like a computer, phone, or digital tablet. 📱

- **Personal Data** is any info relating to an identified or identifiable individual.

- **Service** refers to the Website. That's what we're all about!

- **Service Provider** means any real or legal person who processes data on behalf of the Company. Think of them as the third-party companies or individuals we hire to help us out: providing the Service, performing Service-related services, or just helping us analyze how the Service is used. They're our trusty sidekicks!

- **Usage Data** means data automatically scooped up, generated either by using the Service or from the Service infrastructure itself (for example, how long a page visit lasts).

- **Website** means **hubtoday**, which you can find chilling at `https://ai.hubtoday.app/`. Check it out! 👀

- **You** means the individual hitting up or using the Service, or the company or other legal entity that person is representing when they access or use the Service. Basically, *you*!

## Collecting and Using Your Personal Data

### Types of Data Collected

#### Personal Data
When you use our Service, we might ask you for some personal identifiable information. This is the stuff we can use to contact or identify you, and it could include, but isn't limited to:

- Email address
- Usage data

#### Usage Data
Usage Data? It gets collected automatically when you use the Service. Pretty slick, huh? 😉

Usage Data can cover a lot of ground! It might include your device's Internet Protocol address (aka IP address), browser type and version, which pages of our Service you visit, the time and date of your visit, how long you chill on those pages, unique device identifiers, and other diagnostic data.

When you access the Service via a mobile device, we might automatically scoop up certain info. This includes (but isn't limited to!) the type of mobile device you're rockin', its unique ID, its IP address, your mobile operating system, the mobile internet browser you're using, unique device identifiers, and other diagnostic data. 📱

When you visit our Service (or hit it up via mobile), we might also collect information your browser sends our way. Just a heads-up!

### Tracking Technologies and Cookies
We use Cookies and similar tracking technologies to keep tabs on activity on our Service and stash away certain info. These technologies include beacons, tags, and scripts, which help us collect and track info, plus improve and analyze our Service. The tech we use might include:

- **Cookies or Browser Cookies**: A Cookie is just a small file tucked away on your device. You can totally tell your browser to reject all Cookies or to give you a heads-up when one's being sent. But, if you don't play ball with Cookies, you might miss out on some cool parts of our Service. Unless you've tweaked your browser settings to say "no thanks" to Cookies, our Service might just use 'em anyway.
- **Web Beacons**: Some parts of our Service and our emails might contain tiny electronic files called Web Beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags, and single-pixel gifs). These little guys let the Company (for example) count users who've visited those pages or opened an email, and they're also used for other related website stats (like checking out how popular a certain section is and verifying system and server integrity). Pretty clever, right?

Cookies can be either "Persistent" or "Session" Cookies. When you're offline, Persistent Cookies stick around on your personal computer or mobile device. Session Cookies, on the other hand, vanish into thin air as soon as you close your web browser. Poof!

We use both Session and Persistent Cookies for the following reasons:

- **Necessary / Essential Cookies**
  - **Type**: Session Cookies
  - **Administered by**: Us
  - **Purpose**: These Cookies are super important for dishing out the services available to you through the Website and letting you use some of its cool features. They're key to authenticating users and stopping any sketchy, fraudulent use of user accounts. Without these Cookies, the services you've asked for simply wouldn't fly, and we only use these Cookies to make sure you get those services. 🛡️

- **Cookies Policy / Notice Acceptance Cookies**
  - **Type**: Persistent Cookies
  - **Administered by**: Us
  - **Purpose**: These Cookies are like our little detectives, sussing out whether users have said "yes" to the use of Cookies on the Website.

- **Functionality Cookies**
  - **Type**: Persistent Cookies
  - **Administered by**: Us
  - **Purpose**: These Cookies are all about making your experience smooth sailing! They let us remember the choices you make when you're using the Website, like recalling your login deets or language prefs. The whole point of these Cookies is to give you a more personalized experience, so you don't have to keep re-entering your preferences every single time you use the Website. How convenient is that?! 🥳

For more info about the Cookies we use and your choices regarding 'em, just swing by our Cookies Policy or the Cookies section of our Privacy Policy. Easy peasy!

### Use of Your Personal Data
The Company might use Personal Data for the following reasons:

- **To provide and maintain our Service**, which includes keeping an eye on how our Service is being used.
- **To manage your Account**: This means handling your registration as a Service user. The Personal Data you hand over gives you access to the various features available to you as a registered user.
- **For the performance of a contract**: This covers developing, complying with, and fulfilling the purchase contract for any products, items, or services you've bought, or any other contract you've got with us through the Service.
- **To contact You**: We might reach out to you via email, phone calls, SMS, or other equivalent electronic communication forms (like push notifications from a mobile app). This is to keep you in the loop with updates or informative comms related to features, products, or contracted services, including security updates, whenever they're deemed necessary or reasonable. 📱✉️
- **To provide You with news**, sweet special offers, and general info about other goods, services, and events we dish out. These might be similar to stuff you've already bought or enquired about, unless you've opted out of getting such info, of course.
- **To manage Your requests**: This is all about handling and managing any requests you throw our way. We got you!
- **For business transfers**: We might use your info to evaluate or go through with a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, or any other sale or transfer of some or all of our assets. This could be as a going concern or as part of a bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceeding, where the Personal Data we hold about our Service users is among the assets being transferred. Big business stuff! 💼
- **For other purposes**: We might also use your information for other cool stuff, like data analysis, spotting usage trends, figuring out how effective our promotional campaigns are, and generally evaluating and sprucing up our Service, products, marketing, and your overall experience.

We might share Your personal information in these situations:

- **With Service Providers**: We might share your personal info with Service Providers to monitor and analyze how our Service is being used, and to hit you up.
- **For business transfers**: Your personal information might get shared or transferred during (or in negotiations of) any merger, sale of Company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company. It's all part of the game!
- **With Affiliates**: We might share your info with our Affiliates. If we do, we'll make sure they play by the rules of this Privacy Policy. Affiliates include our parent company, any other subsidiaries, joint venture partners, or other companies that we control or that are under common control with us. Family matters!
- **With Business Partners**: We might team up with our business partners and share your info to offer you certain products, services, or promos. Win-win! ✨
- **With other users**: When you swap personal info or interact in public areas with other users, that info might be seen by all users and could even be put out there publicly outside the Service. So, be mindful!
- **With Your consent**: If you give us the green light, we might spill your personal info for any other purpose. It's all up to you!

### Retention of Your Personal Data
The Company will only hold onto your Personal Data for as long as it's needed for the purposes spelled out in this Privacy Policy. We'll keep and use your Personal Data to the extent necessary to actually follow through on our legal obligations (like if we gotta keep your data to comply with applicable laws), sort out disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies.

The Company will also hang onto Usage Data for internal analysis. Usage Data usually gets a shorter shelf life, unless it's used to beef up the security of our Service, improve its functionality, or if we're legally on the hook to keep this data for longer.

### Transfer of Your Personal Data
Your information (that includes Personal Data!) gets processed at the Company's operating offices and any other spots where the parties involved in the processing are located. This could mean your info might be zipped over to—and kept on—computers located outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction. Just a heads-up, the data protection laws in those places might be different from yours.

Your consent to this Privacy Policy and your submission of such information means you're totally cool with that transfer.

The Company will pull out all the stops to make sure your data is handled securely and in line with this Privacy Policy. We won't be sending your Personal Data to any org or country unless there are some solid controls in place, including top-notch security for your data and other personal info.

### Deletion of Your Personal Data
You have the right to delete your Personal Data, or hit us up to help delete the Personal Data we've collected about you.

Our Service might give you the power to wipe certain info about yourself right from within the Service. Pretty neat, huh?

You can always update, modify, or delete your information by logging into your account (if you've got one!) and hitting up the account settings section that lets you manage your personal info. You can also totally get in touch with us to ask for access to, correction of, or deletion of any personal info you've given us.

But keep in mind, we might need to hang onto certain info when we've got a legal obligation or a lawful basis to do so. Just sayin'!

### Disclosure of Your Personal Data

#### Business Transactions
If the Company gets involved in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your Personal Data might just get transferred. We'll give you a heads-up before your Personal Data is moved over and becomes subject to a whole new Privacy Policy.

#### Law Enforcement
Under certain circumstances, the Company might have to spill your Personal Data if the law demands it or in response to valid requests from public authorities (like a court or government agency). No choice but to comply! 🚔

#### Other Legal Requirements
The Company might also dish out your Personal Data, genuinely believing such action is necessary to:

- Go with the flow of a legal obligation
- Protect and defend the rights or property of the Company
- Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing connected with the Service
- Safeguard the personal safety of Service users or the general public
- Shield against legal liability

### Security of Your Personal Data
The security of Your Personal Data is super important to us, but let's be real: no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% foolproof. While we totally bust our chops to use commercially acceptable ways to shield your Personal Data, we just can't guarantee its absolute security. It's a wild world out there! 🔒

## Children's Privacy
Our Service isn't for anyone under the age of 13. Period. We absolutely don't knowingly scoop up personally identifiable information from anyone under 13. If you're a parent or guardian and you're hip to your kiddo giving us Personal Data, please hit us up. If we find out we've snagged Personal Data from anyone under 13 without verifiable parental consent, we'll totally boot that info from our servers. ASAP! 🙅‍♀️

If we need to lean on consent as the legal basis for processing your info, and your country requires parental consent, we might just ask for your parent's consent before we collect and use that info.

## Links to Other Websites
Our Service might contain links to other websites that aren't run by us. If you click on a third-party link, bam! You'll be whisked away to that third party's site. We seriously recommend you scope out the Privacy Policy of every single site you visit. Better safe than sorry! 🔗

We have absolutely zero control over, and assume no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services. Just keeping it real!

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
We might give our Privacy Policy a facelift from time to time. We'll totally let you know about any changes by dropping the new Privacy Policy right here on this page.

Before the changes kick in, we'll hit you up via email and/or a prominent notice on our Service. Plus, we'll update that "Last Updated date" at the top of this Privacy Policy.

You're totally advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay in the loop about any changes. The changes to this Privacy Policy become effective the moment they're posted on this page. So keep those eyes peeled! 👀
